During a large-scale emergency, the default approach of sending all patients to the nearest hospital creates a critical bottleneck:

The closest facility becomes overwhelmed, leading to long wait times.
Nearby hospitals remain underutilized.
The result: delayed critical care and avoidable fatalities.
Urban healthcare networks lack real-time, city-wide coordination — that’s where our AI Emergency Load Balancer comes in.

The system functions as an autonomous emergency coordinator following a Sense–Think–Act cycle:

🧠 SENSE
Monitors real-time data from hospitals, including:

Bed occupancy
Staff availability
Specialty care units (e.g., trauma, burn, cardiac)
🤔 THINK
Predicts and plans using AI:

XGBoost model forecasts future ER wait times.
An optimization algorithm computes a “Time-to-Treatment” score — balancing travel time with predicted waiting time.
🚑 ACT
Executes dynamic routing and load balancing:

Suggests ambulance dispatch routes.
Notifies hospitals in advance.
Allocates resources to prevent system bottlenecks before they form.
